# 🔍 Enterprise Cybersecurity Risk Assessment  
**ISO 27005 Framework**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this task, I assumed the role of a **Cybersecurity Risk Analyst for CGL Solutions**, a fictional mid-sized IT services company operating across **cloud and on-premises environments**. The objective was to perform a full **enterprise-level cybersecurity risk assessment** to help leadership understand key threats and recommend risk treatment actions.

The risk assessment followed the **ISO 27005 framework** to identify critical assets, analyze threats and vulnerabilities, and determine risk levels using qualitative analysis. Recommendations were mapped to aligned frameworks such as **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A, CIS Controls, and NIST SP 800-53**.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Asset Identification
Critical business assets identified:
- Customer Data  
- On-Premises IT Infrastructure  
- Software/Web Applications (e.g., payment, record-keeping, delivery apps)  
- Cloud Infrastructure  
- Client Cloud Data

### 2️⃣ Threat & Vulnerability Identification
Threat scenarios were developed based on industry trends and typical exposure points.

### 3️⃣ Risk Analysis (Likelihood × Impact)
Using the ISO 27005 qualitative model, risks were scored and prioritized to support management decisions.

### 4️⃣ Control Recommendations
Each risk was mapped to industry best practices and relevant frameworks.

## 📊 Key Results & Risk Assessment Summary

| Asset | Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Recommended Controls |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Customer Database** | Phishing | High | High | **High** | Security awareness training, Advanced email filtering |
| **Client/Company Cloud Data** | Data Theft | Medium | High | **High** | Encryption, DLP, Firewall rules, Policy controls |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Ransomware | Medium | High | **High** | Patch management, Offline backups, EDR |
| **On-Prem Infrastructure** | Insider Threat | Low | High | **Medium** | RBAC, Monitoring |
| **Applications** | DDoS | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | WAF, Anti-DDoS, Network monitoring |

📌 **High-Risk Categories:**  
✔ Phishing  
✔ Ransomware  
✔ Data Theft / Exfiltration

## 🛡️ Recommended Security Controls

| Risk | Control(s) |
|------|-------------|
| Phishing | Email filtering, Mandatory awareness training |
| Ransomware | Patch management, Offline backups, Endpoint detection |
| Insider Threat | Role-based access control, activity monitoring |
| Data Theft | Encryption, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Firewall policy |
| DDoS Attacks | Web Application Firewall, Anti-DDoS subscription |

## 📝 Executive Summary

The assessment identified **five critical assets** essential to CGL Solutions’ operations. **Phishing, data theft, and ransomware pose the most serious risk**, categorized as *High* due to their likelihood and business impact. Implementing **layered security controls** (technical + awareness + monitoring) significantly helps reduce risks to **medium or low**.

🚨 Without proper mitigation, threats could lead to:
- Data breaches & loss of client trust  
- Regulatory fines (GDPR/ISO/NCA implications)  
- Service disruption & revenue loss  

📍 **Conclusion:** A proactive and continuous risk management approach is necessary. Implementing the proposed controls will improve resilience and support compliance with international security standards.

## 💡 Key Learning & Reflection

- Executive-level communication is essential in cybersecurity reporting.  
- Leadership focuses on **business impact**, not full technical deep dives.  
- Time management during presentations is critical — must prioritize headline risks.  
- Risk management is **a continuous process, not a one-time activity**.
